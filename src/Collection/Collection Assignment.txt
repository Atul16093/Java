QNO 1.

Write a Java program that takes integer data from the user and adds it to an ArrayList. Perform the following operations:

1.	Check if a given number exists in the ArrayList or not.
2.	Remove a particular element from the ArrayList and display the updated ArrayList.
     3. Print all the elements of the ArrayList using a for loop.
   4. Print all the elements using the Iterator interface.
   5. Print all the elements using the for-each loop.
   6. Print all the elements in descending order.
  7. Count how many elements are there in the ArrayList. 
Input format :
The first line of the input should contain an integer representing the size of the ArrayList
The second line of the input should contain the elements to be added to the ArrayList
The third line of the input should contain the number to be searched in the ArrayList.
The fourth line of the input should contain the number to be removed from the ArrayList
Output format :
The output should display the elements in the list after the removal.
Refer to the sample output for reference.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
10 12 14 16 18
10
20
Output 1 :
Number 10 exists in the ArrayList
ArrayList after removing 20
10 12 14 16 18 
ArrayList elements using normal for loop
10 12 14 16 18 
ArrayList elements using Iterator interface
10 12 14 16 18 
ArrayList elements using for-each loop
10 12 14 16 18 
ArrayList elements in descending order
18 16 14 12 10 
Number of elements in the ArrayList: 5
Input 2 :
8
20 18 17 45 89 63 27 90
10
20
Output 2 :
Number 10 not exists in the ArrayList
ArrayList after removing 20
18 17 45 89 63 27 90 
ArrayList elements using normal for loop
18 17 45 89 63 27 90 
ArrayList elements using Iterator interface
18 17 45 89 63 27 90 
ArrayList elements using for-each loop
18 17 45 89 63 27 90 
ArrayList elements in descending order
90 89 63 45 27 18 17 
Number of elements



QNO 2.
ArrayList of Objects
Objective: Use an ArrayList to manage custom objects.
Tasks:

Create a Student class with attributes like name, age, and marks.
Add multiple Student objects to an ArrayList.
Display the details of all students.

QNO 3. WAP to create product class with attributes pid, pname, pprice, plocation. create setter, getter and constructor in the class. create 5 objects and store them in arraylist...display all products using for each loop and ListIterator.
after that display only those products whose price is above 500.

QNO 4:

Create a Java program that enables users to dynamically input employee details and store them in an ArrayList.

The program should include a class named "Employee" with private attributes:
1.	employeeName - String
2.	employeeId - int
3.	employeeDepartment - String

The Employee class should have the following methods:
1.	Write a getter method for the above-mentioned attributes.
2.	An overridden toString() method that returns the employee's details.
Input format :
The first line consists of the size of the ArrayList.
The next consecutive line contains employeeName, employeeId, employeeDepartment.
Output format :
The output should display the list of employees.
Refer to the sample output for reference.
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
Elon
101
CEO
Output 1 :
List of All Employees
Employee [employeeName=Elon, employeeId=101, employeeDepartment=CEO]
Input 2 :
2
Elon
101
CEO
Micheal
1001
Manager
Output 2 :
List of All Employees
Employee [employeeName=Elon, employeeId=101, employeeDepartment=CEO]
Employee [employeeName=Micheal, employeeId=1001, employeeDepartment=Manager]

QNo 5:

You are tasked with developing a simple inventory management system for a library that keeps track of book titles using a LinkedList. The program should allow the user to input a specified number of book titles and then display the list of books in the inventory.
Input format :
The first line of the input contains the number of books.
The subsequent lines each contain the title of a book.
Output format :
Displays the final list of books
Refer to the sample output
Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
2
The Great Gatsby
Moby Dick
